# Chess-Interface
Class that interfaces with python chess  

I am working with two Chess AIs that will both use python-chess, so to make my life simpler I plan to use this as a submodule in both of my projects and to avoid rewriting code

# What it does

* Starts a game upon instantiation
* Can make moves
* Return legal moves
* Check if game is over with identification of who won
* Returns FEN for current position
